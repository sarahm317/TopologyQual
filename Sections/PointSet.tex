\section{Basic Point Set Topology}

\begin{prob}{F20}{F20.1}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Give an example of two topological spaces $X,Y$ and a continuous bijection $f: X \to Y$ that is not a homeomorphism.
\item Show that if $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then every continuous bijection between the spaces is a homeomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{solution}
Let $X = [0,1]$ with the standard topology and $Y = [0,1]$ with the trivial topology. Let $f: X \to Y$ be the identity map. Clearly $f$ is bijective. The only open sets in $Y$ are $\varnothing $ and $[0,1]$. Since both $f\inv(\varnothing) = \varnothing$ and $f\inv([0,1]) = [0,1]$ are open in $X$, $f$ is continuous. However, $f$ is not a homeomorphism since $(0,1)$ is open in $X$ but $f(0,1) = (0,1)$ is not open in $Y$.
\end{solution}

\begin{proof}
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space. To show that $f$ is a homeomorphism, it remains to check that $f$ is an open mapping. This is equivalent to proving that $f$ maps closed sets to closed sets. Let $A \sq X$ be a closed set. Since $X$ is compact, $A$ is compact in $X$. Then, $f(A) \sq Y$ must be compact since $f$ is continuous. In a Hausdorff space, any compact set is closed and thus $f(A)$ is closed in $Y$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}{S12}{S12.3}
    Prove the following:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item A closed subspace of a compact space is compact.
        \item A compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed.
        \item If $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous bijection, $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f$ is a homeomorphism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $A \sq X$ is a closed subspace of a compact space. Let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $A$. Extend this collection to an open cover of $X$ by appending the open set $X - A$. Because $X$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover of $X$, say $\{U_1, \ldots, U_n\}$. If some $U_j = X - A$, remove this $U_j$ from the list to obtain a finite subcover for $A$, from the original collection of open sets. As any open cover of $A$ has a finite subcover, $A$ is compact.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
    Assume that $A \sq X$ is a compact subspace of a Hausdorff space. To prove that $A$ is closed, we prove that $X - A$ is open. Let $x \in X - A$. Because $X$ is Hausdorff, for each $a \in A$ there exist open neighborhoods $U_a$ of $x$ and $V_a$ of $a$ where $U_a \cap V_a = \varnothing$. Then, the collection $\{V_a\}_{a \in A}$ forms an open cover of $A$. Since $A$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover, say $\{V_{a_1}, \ldots, V_{a_n}\}$. Then, $U = \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_{a_i}$ is an open set containing $x$ that is disjoint from $A$ and thus is contained in $X - A$. Therefore, $X - A$ is open and so $A$ is closed.
\end{proof}

    See \ref{F20.1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}{S12}{S12.2}
    Let $X,Y,T$ be topological spaces.

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Define the product topology on $X \times Y$.
        \item Show that the projection functions $p_X: X \times Y \to X$ and $p_Y: X \times Y \to Y$ are continuous.
        \item Show that a function $f: T \to X \times Y$ is continuous if and only if both $p_X \circ f$ and $p_Y \circ f$ are continuous.
        \item Show that the product topology on $X \times Y$ is the unique topology that for all spaces $T$ and functions $f$, (c) is satisfied.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces. The product topology on $X \times Y$ has a basis given by $U \times V$ where $U \sq X$ is open and $V \sq Y$ is open. That is, any open set in $X \times Y$ with respect to the product topoology is the union of sets of the form $U \times V$.

\begin{proof}
Let $p_X: X\times Y \to X$ be the projection function onto $X$. Let $U \sq X$ be an open set. Then,
    \[p_X\inv(U) = U \times Y.\]
Because $U$ is open in $X$ and $Y$ is open in $Y$, $U \times Y$ is open in $X \times Y$. Therefore $p_X$ is continuous. Similarly, for any open subset $V$ of $Y$,
    \[p_Y\inv(V) = X \times V\]
which is open in $X \times Y$. Whence both projection functions are continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
    Assume that $f: T \to X \times Y$ is continuous. Let $U \sq X$ and $V \sq Y$ be arbitrary open subsets. Because $p_X$ is continuous, $p_X\inv(U)$ is open in $X \times Y$. Since $f$ is continuous, $f\inv(p_X\inv(U))$ is open in $T$. Therefore, $(p_X \circ f)\inv(U)$ is open in $T$ implying that $p_X \circ f$ is continuous. Similarly, $p_Y\inv(V)$ is open in $X \times Y$ and therefore $f\inv(p_Y\inv(V))$ is open in $T$. This implies that $p_Y \circ f$ is continuous.\\ 

    Now assume that both $p_X \circ f$ and $p_Y \circ f$ are continuous. Let $U \times V$ be an arbitary basic open set in $X \times Y$. Then $U \sq X$ and $V \sq Y$ are both open. Because the projections are continuous, both $p_X\inv(U)$ and $p_Y\inv(V)$ are open in $X \times Y$. Let $t \in f\inv(U \times V)$. If $f(t) = (x,y)$ then $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. This means that $p_X(f(t)) = x \in U$ and $p_Y(f(t)) = y \in V$. That is, $t \in f\inv(p_X\inv(U)) \cap f\inv(p_Y\inv(V))$. Note that the reverse of each of these implications holds and therefore $f\inv(U \times V) = f\inv(p_X\inv(U)) \cap f\inv(p_Y\inv(V))$. As $U$ and $V$ are open and the the compositions are assumed to be continuous, $f\inv(U \times V)$ is the intersection of two open sets and thus must also be open. Since $U \times V$ was an arbitrary basic open set, $f$ is continuous.
