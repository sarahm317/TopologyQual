\section{Fundamental Group}

\begin{prob}{(F20.4)}{F20.4}
Prove that no pair of the following spaces are homeomorphic to one another:
    \[ S^0, \; S^1 \times \R, \; S^1 \times S^2, \; \R \times S^2, \; S^2 \]
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}
First note that $S^0$ is a discrete space while the remaining spaces are not. Therefore, $S^0$ cannot be homeomorphic to any of the other spaces. Because $S^1 \times \R$ and $\R \times S^2$ are unbounded and therefore not compact, neither of these spaces is homeomorphic to either of compact spaces, $S^1 \times S^2$ or $S^2$. As $S^1 \times \R$ is the product of path-connected spaces, $\pi_1(S^1 \times \R) \cong \pi_1(S^1) \times \pi_1(\R) \cong \Z$. Similarly, $\pi_1(\R \times S^2) \cong \pi_1(\R) \times \pi_1(S^2) \cong 0$. As the fundamental group is preserved under homeomorphisms, $S^1 \times \R$ and $\R \times S^2$ are not homeomorphic. Similarly, $S^1 \times S^2$ and $S^2$ are not homeomorphic since $\pi_1(S^1 \times S^2) \cong \Z$ and $\pi_1(S^2) = 0$.
\end{proof}
