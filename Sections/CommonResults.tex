    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item The continuous image of a compact space is compact.

\begin{prop}{}{compactHaus}
    A compact set in a Hausdorff space is closed.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Let $A \sq X$ be a compact subspace of a Hausdorff space. If $X - A = \varnothing$, $A$ is trivially closed. Otherwise, let $x \in X - A$. For each $y \in A$, choose nonempty, disjoint, open sets $U_y$ and $V_y$ such that $x \in U_y$ and $y \in V_y$. Then the collection $\{V_y\}$ is an open cover for $A$. Since $A$ is compact there exists a finite subcover, say $\{V_1,\ldots, V_n\}$. Let $\{U_1,\ldots, U_n\}$ be the open sets that correspond to the chosen $V_k$. Let $U = \bigcap_{k=1}^n U_k$. Then $U$ is an open set containing $x$ that is  disjoint from each $V_y$. In particular, this means that $U \sq X - A$ and as $x \in X - A$ was arbitrary, it follows that $X - A$ is open. Whence $A$ is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}{}{compactClosed}
    A closed subspace of a compact set is compact.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $A \sq X$ is a closed subspace of a compact set. Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $A$. Since $A$ is closed, $X - A$ is open and therefore the collection $\{U_\alpha\} \cup \{X - A\}$ is an open cover for $X$. Because $X$ is compact, we may extract a finite subcover. If $X - A$ is in the finite subcover, removing it from the list yields a finite subcover for $A$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}{}{}
    A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space. Let $g: Y \to X$ be the inverse of $f$. Let $A \sq X$ and notice that $g\inv(A) = f(A)$ since $f$ and $g$ are inverses. Therefore to show that $g$ is continuous, it suffices to show that $f(A)$ is closed for each closed subset $A$ of $X$.\\

    Let $A \sq X$ be closed. Then, $A$ is a closed subset of a compact set and therefore is compact (\ref{thm:compactClosed}). Since the continuous image of a compact set is compact (\ref{thm:ctsImage}), $f(A) \sq Y$ is compact. But, $Y$ is Hausdorff and since a compact set in a Hausdorff space is closed (\ref{thm:compactHaus}), $f(A)$ is closed.
\end{proof}
